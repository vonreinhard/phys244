## Section 1 Introduction
Molecular dynamics is a kind of simulation method to analyze atoms and
molecules’s physical movements.When given the original position and the velocity of
the particles, we could use many-body Newton functions to predict the particles
movement in the future and hence simulate the whole process of the system.

Since we could consider the system would become an ergodic system in the long
term, the computation of each particles’ movement could be processed in the parallel
approach. Thus we use OpenMP as the parallel computation method to assist the
simulation of molecular dynamics. We will test the parallel program and develop the
performance model based on the parameter of processors, the number of particles and
the process time from computation and communcation. For further comparison, we will also utilizz OpenMC
and Cuda method as other parallel technique for this program.
